Some Recent News

AAAI Fellow  I was
			one 
			of eight researchers elected to be a Fellow of the Association for 
			the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in 2018.
Edelman Award Finalist I'm part of a (big) team 
			selected as
			
			one of six finalists for the 2018
			
			INFORMS Franz Edelman Award. The winning team will be announced 
			April 15 at the
			
			INFORMS Conference on Business Analytics and Operations Research.
PNAS Paper  With Paul Milgrom and Ilya 
			Segal, I published a
			
			recent paper in PNAS. It also received some
			press coverage (1,2).
Sabbatical  From July 2017 until June 
			2018 I'm on sabbatical.
			Right now (Jan–Feb 2018), I'm at
			
			Microsoft Research NYC.





Schedule  If you'd like to meet, please check my
		free-busy 
		calendar before proposing a time. 

Academic Affiliations  I'm a member of the
		Computer Science Department at the
		University of British Columbia.  I'm 
		an associate member of the Vancouver 
		School of Economics, and am affiliated with the Institute for 
		Computing, Information & Cognitive Systems (ICICS), the
		Pacific Institute for the Mathematical 
		Sciences (PIMS), the Laboratory 
		for Computational Intelligence (LCI) and the
		Bioinformatics, and Empirical & 
		Theoretical Algorithmics Laboratory (BETA lab). I participate in the
		Game Theory and Decision 
		Theory Seminar (GT-DT), the
		Empirical Algorithmics 
		Reading Group (EARG), and the LCI forum. I'm 
		a faculty 
		associate at the Peter Wall 
		Institute for Advanced Studies. 

Past Academic Affiliations
			In 2016 I was a
		long-term visitor
		at the Simons 
			Institute program on Algorithms and Uncertainty, at UC Berkeley, 
		and a visiting researcher at
		
			Microsoft Research New England. In 2015 I was a
			long-term 
			visitor at the Simons 
			Institute program on
			
			Economics and Computation, at UC Berkeley. On 
		my 2010–11 sabbatical I visited
				Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, 
		and Hebrew University 
				of Jerusalem's 
				Institute for Advanced Studies. I'm a former member of Yoav 
		Shoham's Multiagent Group 
		in the Artificial Intelligence Lab of
		Stanford University's
		Department of Computer Science. 

Industry Affiliations  I currently advise
		Auctionomics, Inc. (and through them, the
		Federal Communications Commission),
		OneChronos, and
		Qudos, Inc. I have co-founded two 
			companies:
		Kudu.ug and 
		Meta-Algorithmic Technologies. In the past, I served as a 
		consultant for
		Zynga, Inc.,
		Trading Dynamics Inc.,
		Ariba Inc., 
		Cariocas Inc., and was scientific advisor to Vancouver-based
		Zite Inc. until it was
		acquired by CNN in 2011.


Editorial  I am chair of the ACM
		Special Interest Group on Electronic 
		Commerce (SIG-Ecom). I am an associate editor of the
		Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ), 
		the ACM Transactions on 
		Economics and Computation (ACM-TEAC), and
		AI Access, 
		and an Advisory Board member for the Journal of AI Research (JAIR). I was program chair for
		ACM-EC in 2012, and have been 
		tutorial chair for IJCAI,
		AAAI 
		and ACM-EC. I've guest edited for 
		Games and Economic Behavior (GEB),
		ACM-TEAC, and
		AI Magazine. I 
		have been an area chair for IJCAI, served on senior program committees at
		AAAI,
		AAMAS,
		ACM-EC,
		IJCAI, and UAI, and on 
		program committees at
		
		AMEC, AMMA,
		CP,
		CROCS,
		TADA.




				 
			



Books  I coauthored
			Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, 
			Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations, and
			Essentials of Game Theory: A 
			Concise, Multidisciplinary Introduction, 
			both 
			with Yoav 
		Shoham.
		


Graduate Students and Postdocs  My current students are: 
		Chris Cameron (PhD);
		
		Jason Hartford (PhD; MSc 2016); Neil 
		Newman (PhD; MSc 2016); Hedeyat Zarkoob (PhD).
		Alice Gao and
		Lars Kotthoff are current postdocs, and Frank Hutter 
		is a former postdoc (left 2013) My past graduate students are: 
		James Wright 
		(PhD 2016); 
		Steve Ramage 
		(MSc 2015); 
		David Thompson (PhD 2015; MSc. 
		2007); 
		
		Alexandre Fréchette (left for Google); 
		Lin Xu (PhD 2014); Baharak Rastegari 
		(PhD 2013); 
		Chris Thornton (MSc 2012);   
		Albert Xin Jiang 
		(PhD 2011; MSc. 2006),   
		Chris Nell (MSc. 2011), James Wright 
		(MSc. 2010);
		Frank 
		Hutter (PhD 2009); Ashiqur KhudaBukhsh

Prospective Students  For students not enrolled at UBC: please
		do not contact me directly; instead,
		apply to my department and indicate an interest in working with me. 
		You can learn about my research area from
		my free online class. I am likely to take on new PhD students from outside UBC 
		only when I am already familiar with their publications from conferences 
		that I attend. 
		I am likely to take on other students for an MSc with the possibility of 
		continuing to a PhD. For students who are already at UBC: 
		please take my grad class and drop by
		GT-DT if you're 
		interested in game theory/multiagent systems, or 
		take Holger 
		Hoos' grad class and drop by
		EARG if you're 
		interested in empirical algorithmics.
