Information



Ronald Fearing is a
professor in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
at Univ. of California, Berkeley, which he joined in Jan. 1988. 
He was Vice-Chair for Undergraduate Matters from 2000-2006,
and is Vice-Chair for Graduate Matters (2016-present). His current
research interests are in bioinspired 
milli-robotics, including flying and crawling
milli-robots, cooperative locomotion, 
rapid prototyping, parallel nano-grasping (gecko adhesion)
and micro-assembly. He has worked in tactile sensing, teletaction,
and dextrous manipulation.  He has a PhD from Stanford in EE (1988)
and SB and SM in EECS from MIT (1983).  He received the
Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1991, and is the co-inventor
on 18 US and international patents.
