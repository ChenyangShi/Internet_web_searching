Information




     I am an Assistant Professor at University of Toronto. Prior coming to Toronto, in 2012/2013, I was a Research Assistant Professor at  Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, an academic institute located in the campus of University of Chicago.
    I did my postdoc with Prof.  Sven Dickinson at University of Toronto in 2011/2012. I finished my PhD in 2010 at University of Ljubljana in Slovenia in the group of Prof.  Ales Leonardis. In 2010, I was visiting
    Prof.  Trevor Darrell's group at UC Berkeley and ICSI. I got my BSc degree in Applied Math at University of Ljubljana. 
More information is in my CV.






Information for Prospective Students


     I'm looking for motivated MSc/PhD and visiting students, as well as a postdoc.




Research Interests

My work is in the area of Computer Vision. My main research interests are 2D and 3D object detection, particularly scalable multi-class detection, 
object segmentation and image labeling, and (3D) scene understanding. 
I am also interested in the interplay between language and vision: generating sentential descriptions about complex scenes, as well as
using textual descriptions for better scene parsing (e.g., in the scenario of the human-robot interaction).

“Computer scientists from the University of Toronto have created a software program that helps users avoid fashion faux pas.


Raquel Urtasun and Sanja Fidler, along with colleagues in Spain, designed an algorithm that analyzes a person's photograph to determine whether the wearer's outfit is stylish. It also suggests ways to improve the ensemble and the subject's overall appeal.”



&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHarper's BazaarBy Sarah Lindig

“Researchers at the University of Toronto have developed an algorithm that will analyze your photo and make suggestions to improve it. As explained in the report provided by the Computer Vision Foundation, "People want to look good; business or casual, elegant or sporty, sexy but not slutty, and of course trendy, particularly so when putting their picture online. Our goal is to learn and predict how fashionable a person looks on a photograph and suggest subtle improvements the user could make to improve her/his appeal." &nbsp&nbsp&nbspUm... yes, please!

“AI is ready to help us live better in many domains, the professors say, and scientists are only starting to envision what can be done with it. Inviting a thinking robot to rifle through our closets might be the softest possible introduction to a whole new world.
