Research
My work is in the areas of
  computer vision and perception for autonomous systems. My interests are
  in the interpretation of perception data (both 2-D and 3-D), including
  building models of environments. Current research directions include:

Efficient techniques for object/category recognition
Use of contextual information, in particular 3-D
       geometry from images, for scene analysis
Symbolic knowledge for scene interpretation and
       reconstruction
Motion analysis for feature extraction and event
       detection in video clips
Efficient tools for the analysis of dynamic 3-D point
       clouds ("3-D signal processing")
Perception for autonomous systems
Detection, tracking, and prediction in dynamic
       environments
