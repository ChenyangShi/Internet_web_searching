ABOUT me


                  I am an Associate Professor  in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Engineering with highest honors from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
                


















RESEARCHinterests



                  My research interests are in human-computer interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing (Ubicomp). I investigate tools and methods to support the development of novel ubiquitous computing systems and techniques and models to facilitate user interactions with off-the-desktop computing devices and services. 
                

                  My current work also includes the design and evaluation of assistive technologies and context sensing applications.

forPROSPECTIVEstudents



                  If you are already a student at UofT and are interested in working with me, please check out my recent research projects & publications before emailing me. In general, I prefer to work with students who can commit to at least two terms of research.
                

                  If you want to do a PhD with me, you will need to apply & get accepted at the department level. I do not have any control over this process.
