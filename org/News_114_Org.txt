I am Professor of Computer Science in the Department of Computer and 
Mathematical Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough.  I joined 
the University of Toronto in October, 
2003.  Prior to that I worked in the Digital Video Analysis and 
Perceptual Document Analysis Groups at the 
 Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)  
for 4 years.  Before that I was on faculty at 
 Queen's University  in Kingston.

I served as Associate Editor (2000-2003) and then as Associate 
Editor-in-Chief (2004-2008) for 
 IEEE Transactions on Pattern 
Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI).  I also served as Program 
Co-Chair of IEEE CVPR (2003), ECCV (2014), and as Area Chair for numerous 
vision and learning conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, NIPS, ICML).  At present 
I serve on the Advisory Board for IEEE PAMI.  I am also a Senior Fellow of the 
 Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)  
and a Faculty Member of the  Vector Institute .


My research interests include aspects of computer vision, image 
processing, visual perception and visual neuroscience.  Most of my 
specific research has focused on mathematical foundations and algorithms 
for visual motion analysis, tracking, human pose and motion estimation, 
and models of motion perception and stereopsis.
