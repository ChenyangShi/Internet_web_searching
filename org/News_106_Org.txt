Superimages: Image Generalization through Camera Model
  Design
Images are used in computer graphics and visualization to convey
  information. Images are computed by sampling data with rays defined by a
  camera model. Most images used in computer graphics and visualization are
  computed using the planar pinhole camera model, which suffers from important
  limitations such as uniform sampling rate, and single viewpoint. We propose
  to overcome these limitations through camera model design, an
  infrastructure-level innovation with broad applicability, including in 3-D
  scene exploration, remote visualization, acceleration of high-cost rendering
  effects, and video surveillance.




Augmented
  Reality Surgical Telementoring: 
Prior-art telestrator-based surgical telementoring systems require
  a trainee surgeon to shift focus frequently between the operating field and a
  nearby monitor to acquire and apply instructions from a remote mentor. We
  present a novel approach to surgical telementoring where annotations are
  superimposed directly onto the surgical field using an augmented reality (AR)
  simulated transparent display. Annotations are anchored to
  the surgical field as the trainee tablet moves and as the surgical field
  deforms or becomes occluded.




Computer
  Animation Instructor Avatars for Research on Non-Verbal Communication in
  Education: 
Almost a century
  ago, Edward Sapir noted that we “respond to gestures with an extreme
  alertness” according to “an elaborate and secret code that is
  written nowhere, known to none, and understood by all”. We are a team
  of computer science and psychology researchers who have partnered with the
  long term goal of breaking the code of effective instructor gestures in
  education. We are developing a system of computer animation instructor
  avatars and we are using it to research instructor gesture effectiveness in
  the context of mathematics learning. We examine both gestures that might
  convey an appealing and engaging instructor personality and gestures that
  elucidate the mathematical concepts directly.
