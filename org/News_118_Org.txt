Short bio
Alec Jacobson is an Assistant Professor and Canada Research Chair in the
Department of Computer Science at University of Toronto. Before that he was a
post-doctoral researcher at Columbia University working with Prof. Eitan
Grinspun. He received a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich advised by
Prof. Olga Sorkine-Hornung, and an MA and BA in Computer Science and
Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York
University. His thesis on real-time deformation techniques for 2D and 3D shapes
was awarded the ETH Medal and the Eurographics Best PhD award. Leveraging ideas
from differential geometry and finite-element analysis, his work in geometry
processing improves exposure of geometric quantities, while his novel user
interfaces reduce human effort and increase exploration. He has published
several papers in the proceedings of SIGGRAPH. He leads development of the
widely used geometry processing library, libigl, winner of the 2015 SGP
software award. In 2017, he received the Eurographics Young Researcher Award.

Frequently Asked Questions
These are some questions that I receive fairly regularly in cold-call emails.
Will you hire me as a PhD Student?
Maybe! The first step is to apply directly to the graduate program of the
Department of Computer
Science.
Our regular deadline is in December for students applying to start in the
following Fall. Our program is very competitive. Most students put months of
effort into their application package. Your research interests should match or
harmonize with mine (see publications above for an idea). You should not only
mention this in your application (and mention me by name), but also write about
how and why we’re a great match. If you’d like to chat about research or life
at dgp as a graduate student, feel free to contact me.
Will you hire me as a postdoc?
Maybe! Postdoc positions are very limited. If I’m not already aware of your
research then chances are much smaller. In any case, contact me to begin the
conversation. Have a one-to-two year research agenda prepared.
In nearly all circumstances, I will ask you to apply for a postdoc fellowship
(and I will help you apply). Please review relevant fellowships, including
those speicifically for Canadian permanent residences (if applicable) or
“mobility” fellowships from your home country/country of PhD.
I’m an undergrad from University of Toronto, could I work as your research
assistant?
Maybe! Undergraduate research assistantships are limited and competitive. You
should be a proficient programmer and feel confident in Calculus and Linear
Algebra. If you haven’t already, sign up for the undergraduate Computer
Graphics course and my graduate-level Geometry Processing course (and
probably also David Levin’s Computational Fabrication and Kyros Kutulakus’s
Foundations of Computational Vision courses). Good performance in these
courses will put you at a great advantage. Also, start attending the dgp
graphics reading group and the dgp graphics seminar talks. If you’re hoping to
work with me over the summer, reach out to me around January/February. Give an
indication of what research of mine most interests you and what sort of way you
could imagine yourself contributing (in practice, we will try to find a
current project to match you with, but this information will help).
I’m an undergrad from X ≠ Unversity of Toronto, could I work as a your
research assistant?
Maybe! External undergraduate research assistantships are even more limited
than internal ones. If you can secure or apply for funding
from your home institution or country then you will be at a great advantage. If
you do not already have a funding source, then before contacting me
investigate whether fellowships for exchange programs etc. exist in your
institution/country. If there are none, then consider applying to one of the
summer undergraduate research fellowship programs at University of Toronto
(e.g., at the Fields Institute). Finally, if you still cannot find funding,
contact me with an application including a statement of purpose, faculty
references, (unofficial) transcripts, and resume.
